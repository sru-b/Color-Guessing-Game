# Color-Guessing-Game

The Great RGB Color Guessing Game is game in which the player is provided with the RGB reference of a color. 
The user then has to choose the correct color from some colors displayed on the screen. The game tests the user on 
his/her ability to corelate colors to their RGB value. The **Javascript** logic for the game has been made possible
with the use of **jQuery** that helped reference specific elements(classes, id or tags) of the orirginal **HTML** document.
Other simple stylistic details of the webpage have been taken care using **CSS**.

A demonstration video of the game is shown below:
