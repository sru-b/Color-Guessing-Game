# Color-Guessing-Game

The Great RGB Color Guessing Game is game in which the player is provided with the RGB reference of a color. 
The user then has to choose the correct color from some colors displayed on the screen. The game tests the user on 
his/her ability to corelate colors to their RGB value. The Javascript logic for the game has been made possible
with the use of jQuery that helped reference specific elements(classes, id or tags) of the orirginal HTML document.
Other simple stylistic details of the webpage have been taken care using CSS.

The game has two difficulty modes: Easy and Hard modes.
In the easy mode, the user is given 3 colors ot choose from as shown in teh image below.
